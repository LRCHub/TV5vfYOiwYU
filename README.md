[00:15.25] Forfeit the game
[00:16.38] Before somebody else
[00:17.69] Takes you out of the frame
[00:18.95] Puts your name to shame
[00:20.14] Cover up your face
[00:21.44] You can't run the race
[00:22.44] The pace is too fast
[00:23.94] You just won't last
[00:33.44] 
[00:35.78] You love the way I look at you
[00:40.64] While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
[00:45.81] You take away if I give in
[00:50.87] My life
[00:52.12] My pride is broken
[01:01.12] 
[00:55.72] You like to think you're never wrong
[00:58.74] (You live what you've learned)
[01:00.56] You have to act like you're someone
[01:03.67] (You live what you've learned)
[01:05.69] You want someone to hurt like you
[01:08.68] (You live what you've learned)
[01:10.62] You want to share what you've been through
[01:13.72] (You live what you've learned)
[01:28.72] 
[01:21.08] You love the things I say I'll do
[01:25.68] The way I'll hurt myself again just to get back at you
[01:30.90] You take away when I give in
[01:36.10] My life
[01:37.26] My pride is broken
[01:46.26] 
[01:40.63] You like to think you're never wrong
[01:44.06] (You live what you've learned)
[01:45.72] You want to act like you're someone
[01:48.85] (You live what you've learned)
[01:50.85] You want someone to hurt like you
[01:53.88] (You live what you've learned)
[01:55.87] You want to share what you've been through
[01:59.36] (You live what you've learned)
